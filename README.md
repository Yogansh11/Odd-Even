My Second Angular Project Using Angular Materials.

Requiremets:-

Create 3 new Components â€“ GameControl, Even & Odd.
The GameControl component should have start and stop buttons of the game.
When starting the game, an event (holding an increment number) should get emitted each second.(setInterval)
The event should be listenable from outside the component.
When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted.(ClearInterval)
The odd component should display -> Odd numbers :- 5
The even component should display -> Even numbers :- 6
Style the element holding your output text differently in both components. (Text color etc.)
